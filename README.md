"SpyUO is a tool to see decrypted and decompressed packets sent and received by UO client."

This project will start with some minor fixes/enhancements to Ben1024's useful work on SpyUO.

The goal of this continuation is:
Primarily to maintain support for running on official servers.
Potentially QOL updates and additional packet support.
